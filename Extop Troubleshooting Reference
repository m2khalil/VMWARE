esxtop 
it will show the cpu screen updating every 2 seconds
type "V" it will show only vms

here in vms screen
%rdy value can helpful if the underlying host has some cpu contention.
$CSTP ideally should be zero or below 5% is ok.

type "m" will show the memory screen
here SWCUR and SWTCH are swap values, high swap values means memory lack are there.
here MCTL2 is showing about balooning/if it is enabled or not.
if the value is "N" then you dont have vmware tools installed, balooning driver is based on vmtools.
if MCTLTGT>MCTLSZ : then showing balooning activity will increase in future


type "d" for disk
will show the physcail storage adaptor.
DAVG/cmd : device average IO lantency, storage device latency itself.isci, fiber channel latency, this latency is acceptable upto 9ms
KAVG/cmd:  how much latency vSphere is causing itself. Kernal average latency should be below  1 MS


type "v" disk in vm.
will show the IO latency in vms.
type "h" for help.
